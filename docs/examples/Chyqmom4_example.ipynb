The ```chyqmom4``` class takes in a very speficific data format as input: the input must be a 2D ```numpy.ndarray``` type.  As well, for the sake of the GPUs, it must also be continuous in memory, and the values must be ```numpy.float32``` types. \n",

    "To ensure that an array satisfies these prereq, the simplest way is to use PyCuda's ```aligned_empty``` method to create an empty numpy array that is continuous in memory. However, ```numpy.ndarray``` provides a simple way to check whether an existing array is already continuous.\n",
